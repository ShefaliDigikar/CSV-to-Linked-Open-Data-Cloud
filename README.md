# CSV to Linked Open Data Cloud 
  The LOD Cloud is a Knowledge Graph that simply represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities â€“ objects, events or concepts as a Semantic Web of Linked Data. It provides a framework for data integration and visualization. Linking data sets from multiple sources often creates ambiguity and redundancy in data, but making use of LOD avoids such problems.

   1. Convert the CSV file into RDF triples(Subject Predicate Object). Product ID is chosen as subject, attribute name as predicate, and specification details as object.
  
   2. The nodes in a LOD cloud are always unique. The nodes denote the subjects and objects in the triples, and the predicate denotes the edges in the graph.
